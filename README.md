# WIT React Challenge

This is the solution to the challenge proposed by WIT.
The main goal of this project is to developed a weather forecast website capable of showing the current temperature and
the 5-day weather forecast for a city entered by the user.
Other features were implemented as well, such as the ability to select the temperature measurement unit between
**Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin**, and a **graph with the evolution of the temperature**.
